The Capped Voting app is used to create and participate in votes. Votes can be linked to an action, such as issuing a new token or transfering funds, or be purely informative.

## Features
- Create a new informative vote.
- Vote "yes" or "no" on open votes.
- See details about open and past votes, including how many tokens have voted and how much time is left before a vote is over.
- Give the Voting app permission to perform actions in other apps so those actions have to be approved by a tokenholder vote before they can be executed.
- **Vote weight is determined by the minimum of two token balances**
- Votes that flip the result after 75% vote time has passed will automatically extend vote by 50% of `vote_time - existing_extension`
- Duplicate scripts are disallowed at the same time
